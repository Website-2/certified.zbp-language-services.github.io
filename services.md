<h5>Document translation</h5>
<br>
* Languages I can help with: German to English, English to German
* Examples of document types: personal documents for wedding ceremonies, visa and passport applications, etc., such as birth certificates, certificates of no impediment,  marriage certificates, passports, driver's licences, educational certificates

* Need a certified interpreter? No problem either, I can help with visits to the registry office, bilingual wedding days, notary appointments, and general registration appointments, even if they're last minute

><small>"She was fabulous on every single interview she did – always super clear, great diction, the emotions of the speakers really came through, and I also loved how she would say ‘Moderator’ or ‘Panelist’ each time someone spoke so it was clear who we were hearing – it makes note-taking so much easier!"<br>
